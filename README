== Description:

This is a little script to allow you to get the latest news from your favorite rss feeds. What it started out as is a way to see the latest news headlines without having to jump over to a browser. The app turned into more of a commandline rss reader.

Usage:

The only thing that works right now is getting all the titles from your sections. like:

    termnews News all all

More will come later, but this is at least a start.

== Personal Note:

This is my first python application so please excuse the learning curve.
